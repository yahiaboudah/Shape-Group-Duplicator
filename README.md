# Shape-Group-Duplicator
Duplicate shape groups with a button click in after effects.


# How to run
You can run the script in after effects by first moving it to the Scripts folder, and then running it from within After Effects by going to File>Scripts>[A List Of Scripts]>Duplicator.jsx
Or simply go to File>Scripts>Run Script File and select duplicator.jsx

# How to use
There's not really a lot to it. If you want to duplicate a group of a shape layer a number of times without going Ctrl-C Ctrl-V and having to deal with the change of position, then use Duplicator! The UI is very intuitive to use. Click on refresh to load the layers in the currently active composition, then the list of shape layer groups will automatically be loaded in the "Groups" dropdown menu (You can pick the group that you want to duplicate from there). Then hit Duplicate as many times as you'd like!
